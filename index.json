This is made possible through use of a partially common path interferometer design in which the coherence time τ is sampled in a “rotating frame.” Rapid, continuous scanning of τ increases the duty cycle of signal collection, rejects the majority of excitation pulse scatter, and enables the measurement of a complete 2D spectrum in 92 ms, which minimizes the influence of pulse intensity and delay fluctuations on the 2D spectrum.

For time-resolved spectroscopy, the wave description is of particular interest and utility. Unfortunately, the detectors available for measuring visible light are fundamentally \u0026ldquo;photon detectors\u0026rdquo; (also known as \u0026ldquo;square-law\u0026rdquo; detectors1) since they measure the intensity ($I \\propto E^2$) of light rather than its field ($E$). This is because the frequency of visible light is too high (hundreds of terahertz) for detectors to respond to the extremely fast oscillations of the electric field like an antenna does for radio waves. Intensity is basically a measure of power, which means that information about the light wave\u0026rsquo;s phase is lost (as implied by squaring the field).\n\r\rSchematic of spectral interferometry. A signal field ($E_S$) and reference field ($E_R$) are combined, and then spectrally resolved and detected in a spectrograph.\r\r\rFor many nonlinear spectroscopy techniques, we need to measure the complete electric field of the signal, including its phase. Luckily, there are methods for achieving this. One particularly powerful approach is known as spectral interferometry (SI).2 SI involves spatially overlapping a known \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; field with the unknown signal field and then measuring the spectrum of the combined fields (known as a spectral interferogram). The resulting spectral interference encodes the magnitude and phase of the signal field, which can be extracting using the Fourier-transform spectral interferometry (FTSI) algorithm.3\nMathematical basis of spectral interferometry A spectral interferogram of spatially-overlapped signal $\\hat{E}_s$ and reference $\\hat{E}_r$ fields is measured by a spectrally-resolved square-law detector (i.e., $I \\propto E^2$), yielding the intensity of the sum of the fields as a function of angular frequency ($\\omega = 2\\pi \\nu$) $$ I_{sr}(\\omega) = \\left| \\hat{E}_s(\\omega) + \\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\right|^2 . \\tag{1} $$ This can be expanded to yield $$ I_{sr}(\\omega) = \\left| \\hat{E}_s(\\omega) \\right|^2 + \\left| \\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\right|^2 + \\hat{E}_s(\\omega)\\hat{E}_r^*(\\omega) + \\hat{E}_s^*(\\omega)\\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\tag{2} $$ where the first two terms are the spectra of the signal and reference fields and the last two terms are the \u0026ldquo;interference terms\u0026rdquo;, which contain the phase information.\n Notes on notation\n Variables topped with a circumflex (e.g., $\\hat{z}$) are complex-valued. $\\left| \\hat{z} \\right|$ is the absolute value of complex quantity $\\hat{z}$. $\\hat{z}^*$ is the complex conjugate of $\\hat{z}$. A complex number $\\hat{z}$ can be expressed in terms of its real $a = (\\hat{z} + \\hat{z}^*)/2$ and imaginary $b = (\\hat{z} - \\hat{z}^*)/2$ parts or its absolute value $\\left| z \\right| = (\\hat{z}\\hat{z}^*)^{1/ 2}$ and phase $\\phi$: $$\\hat{z} = a + ib = \\left| \\hat{z} \\right| \\exp (i \\phi)$$    We can rewrite the first interference term as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{E}_s(\\omega)\\hat{E}_r^* (\\omega) \u0026amp; = \\left| \\hat{E}_s(\\omega) \\right| \\exp \\left[ i \\phi_s(\\omega) \\right] \\times \\left\\{ \\left| \\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\right| \\exp \\left[ i \\phi_r(\\omega) \\right] \\right\\}^* \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\left| \\hat{E}_s(\\omega) \\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\right| \\exp \\left[ i \\left\\{ \\phi_s(\\omega) - \\phi_r(\\omega) \\right\\} \\right] \\\\\n\u0026amp; = \\left| \\hat{E}_s(\\omega) \\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\right| \\exp \\left[ i \\Delta\\phi(\\omega)\\right] \\end{aligned} \\tag{3} $$\nwhere $\\Delta\\phi(\\omega) = \\phi_s(\\omega) - \\phi_r(\\omega)$ is the relative phase of the signal and reference fields.4 We can express $\\Delta\\phi$ in terms of a linear phase (i.e., delay) and the sum of all other components:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi(\\omega) = \\omega (t_s - t_r) + \\Delta\\phi^\\prime(\\omega) . \\tag{4}$$\nUsing this new form for $\\Delta\\phi$, the interference term becomes\n$$ \\hat{E}_s(\\omega)\\hat{E}_r^*(\\omega) = \\left| \\hat{E}_s(\\omega) \\hat{E}_r(\\omega) \\right| \\exp \\left[ i \\omega (t_s - t_r) \\right] \\exp \\left[ i \\Delta\\phi^\\prime(\\omega)\\right] . \\tag{5}$$\nTherefore, by the Fourier modulation theorem5, when the reference field is delayed relative to the signal field (i.e., $t_s - t_r \u0026lt; 0$), the interference term $\\hat{E}_s(\\omega)\\hat{E}_r^*(\\omega)$ appears as a peak on the negative side of $t = 0$ once Fourier transformed to the time domain.\nFourier-transform spectral interferometry algorithm Let\u0026rsquo;s simulate a spectral interferogram between an exponentially-damped sinusoidal \u0026ldquo;signal\u0026rdquo; field $E_s(t)$ and a \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; field with a Gaussian temporal field envelope $E_r(t)$. The signal field is given by\n$$ E_s(t) =\\mathrm{Re}\\left\\lbrace \\mathrm{exp}\\left\\lbrack \\left(2\\pi if_s^0 -\\frac{1}{\\tau_s }\\right)t\\right\\rbrack H\\left(t\\right)\\right\\rbrace $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Re}\\lbrace\\hat{z}\\rbrace$ selects the real part of complex value $\\hat{z}$, $f_s^0$ is the signal center frequency, $\\tau_s$ is the exponential damping time constant, $t$ is time, and $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.6 The reference field is given by\n$$ E_r(t) =\\mathrm{Re}\\left\\lbrace G\\left(t;T_r ,\\mathrm{FWHM}\\right)\\;\\mathrm{exp}\\left\\lbrack 2\\pi if_r^0 \\left(t-T_r \\right)\\right\\rbrack \\right\\rbrace $$\nwhere $G(t; T_r, \\mathrm{FWHM})$ is a Gaussian function of $t$ with delay $T_r$ and full-width at half-maximum $\\mathrm{FWHM}$, and $f_r^0$ is the reference center frequency. These fields are plotted below.\n  Figure 1. Signal and reference fields.  For the sake of example, we will use the following parameter values:\n         $f_s^0$ $0.375 \\,\\mathrm{fs}^{-1} \\ (375 \\,\\mathrm{THz})$   $\\tau_s$ $30 \\,\\mathrm{fs}$   $f_r^0$ $0.375 \\,\\mathrm{fs}^{-1} \\ (375 \\,\\mathrm{THz})$   $\\mathrm{FWHM}$ $15 \\,\\mathrm{fs}$   $T_r$ $500 \\,\\mathrm{fs}$    To simulate the measured spectral interferogram, we add the Fourier-transformed signal and reference fields together, square the result (since we measure intensity), and eliminate the negative frequency part using the Heaviside step function (since a spectrometer only resolves positive frequencies). The resulting spectral interferogram $|\\hat{E}_s(f) + \\hat{E}_r(f)|^2 H(f)$ is shown below. For simplicity, I\u0026rsquo;m only plotting the real part of complex data.\n  Figure 2. Simulated spectral interferogram.  After Fourier transforming our interferogram, we get the complex-valued time-domain interferogram $\\hat{I}_{sr}(t)$ plotted below.\n  Figure 3. Spectral interferogram in the time domain.  To isolate $\\hat{E}_s \\hat{E}_r^*$, we need to select the peak at negative time (as we proved in the previous section) using the Heaviside step function (orange line, above). The isolated interference term $\\hat{E}_s(t) \\hat{E}_r^*(t) = \\hat{I}_{sr}(t) H(-(t+200))$ is plotted below.\n  Figure 4. Isolated signal–reference interference term.  Fourier transforming back to the frequency domain yields the product of signal and reference fields $\\hat{E}_s(f) \\hat{E}_r^*(f)$ plotted below.\n  Figure 5. Signal–reference interference term in the frequency domain.  Notice that the spectrum is highly modulated. This is due to the time delay between the signal and reference fields and is an effect we\u0026rsquo;d like to remove. To fully isolate the signal field, we divide the signal\u0026ndash;reference product $\\hat{E}_s(f) \\hat{E}_r^*(f)$ by the reference field $|\\hat{E}_r(f)| \\exp (-2\\pi ifT_r)$. The factor $\\exp (-2\\pi ifT_r)$ eliminates the delay-induced modulation while $|\\hat{E}_r(f)|$ corrects for the reference field\u0026rsquo;s finite spectrum (whose effect is primarily to attenuate the extremities of the signal).\n  Figure 6. Recovered signal field.  Finally, we can Fourier transform back to the time domain to compare the recovered signal field $\\hat{E}_s \\hat{E}_r^* / |\\hat{E}_r| \\exp (-2\\pi ifT_r)$ to the exact signal field $E_s$.\n  Figure 7. Comparison between the recovered signal field and the exact signal field.  Notice that the rising edge of the signal field near $t = 0$ is somewhat smoothed in the recovered signal field compared to the exact signal field. This arises at least partially due to the reduction in resolution induced by Fourier filtering (when isolating $E_s E_r^*$). Contrary to the case of this simulation, experimental signals do not have an infinitely sharp rise and therefore will not exhibit this discrepancy.\nAppendices (A.I) Fourier transform7 By my convention, the (forward) Fourier transform is used to go from the frequency domain to the time domain while the inverse Fourier transform goes from time to frequency (i.e., $s \\equiv t$ and $x \\equiv \\nu$).\n(Forward) Fourier transform $$ F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x) \\exp \\left( -2 \\pi i s x \\right) dx \\tag{A.I.1}$$\nInverse Fourier transform $$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(s) \\exp \\left( 2 \\pi i s x \\right) ds \\tag{A.I.2}$$\n(A.II) Electric fields Since electric fields are measurable, they must be real-valued in the time domain.\n$$ \\hat{E}(\\omega) = e(\\omega) \\exp \\left[ i \\phi(\\omega) \\right] \\tag{A.II.1}$$\n$$ E(t) = e(t) \\cos \\left[ \\phi(t) \\right] \\tag{A.II.2}$$\nBased on the above Fourier transform conventions,\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\hat{E}(\\omega) \\exp \\left( - i \\omega t \\right) d\\omega \\tag{A.II.3}$$\n$$ \\hat{E}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty E(t) \\exp \\left( i \\omega t \\right) dt \\tag{A.II.4}$$\n Square-law detector - Wikipedia ^ Spectral Interferometry - frog.gatech.edu ^ L.

In other words, the 50 MB of image data only contains 5 MB of information. This begs the question: can we directly measure the 5 MB of information instead? It turns out that you can do this using what is known as compressive (or compressed) sensing. These methods enable the reconstruction of a complete data set from measurements of a limited subset of the data.\n Compressive sensing is a mathematical formation of Occam's razor: when there is insufficient information to arrive at a unique solution, we choose the \"simplest\" solution.   Compressive sensing involves the reconstruction of a complete data set from measurements of a limited subset of the data. -- In a mathematical sense, compressive sensing seeks to solve an underdetermined linear system where there are fewer equations (e.g., measured data points) than unknowns (e.g., all desired data points) using a minimum of prior knowledge regarding the data. Compressive sensing combines concepts for data compression and statistical sparsity to achieve this. For example, one can compress an image (represented by a matrix) by applying to it a transform which concentrates most of the image intensity into a few elements and then throwing out the remaining elements that have zero (or nearly zero) intensity. The product of a such a transform, where most elements are zero, is called a sparse matrix. A transform that generates a sparse matrix for a particular data set is therefore called a sparsifying transform. The key is that we know which transform(s) will sparsify a specific type of data. In the case of images, the same set of transforms (discrete cosine transform, wavelet transform, etc) tends to work well for all types of images. To use this strategy for compressive sensing, we must first know in advance which transform(s) will sparsify our data.\nThe compressive sensing method The general procedure for using compressive sensing goes as follows. First, we measure a subset (specified by observation matrix $\\mathbf A$) of the complete data set. We then apply the inverse of the sparsifying transform to $\\mathbf A$. Next, we use linear algebra methods to solve for the complete data set using the measured data points. This yields the data set, but in a transformed state due to the sparsifying transform applied to $\\mathbf A$.

The method is discussed in more detail in this post. CS has the potential to enable new experiments and capabilities that were not previously feasible, such as densely pixelated 2D image sensors for the infrared and terahertz spectral regimes.\nIn my research, I demonstrated how CS can be employed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to reduce the number of measurements needed to construct a 2D spectrum.

Despite their importance, a quantitative experimental evaluation of these processes has proven elusive due to the inherent challenge of exactly separating single-exciton and multi-exciton dynamics, whose spectroscopic signatures overlap in time, spectrum, and excitation fluence. Here, we measure pump fluence-dependent absolute pump-probe transients of indium arsenide QDs, refreshing the sample using beam scanning to limit repetitive excitation. Focusing on the low fluence limit near the onset of bi-exciton formation, excitation conditions were precisely controlled and characterized by averaging Poisson-distributed excitation statistics over all three spatial dimensions of the pump and probe beam spatial profiles to determine the average excitation probability. A saturation model is developed to uniquely decompose the pump-probe signal into single-exciton and bi-exciton signals. This method harnesses the distinct pump-fluence scaling of absolute pump-probe signals from singly- and doubly-excited QDs without any assumptions regarding the relative timescales or amplitudes of single-exciton and bi-exciton signals. Probing in the bulk-like region of the QD absorption spectrum, the signal from bi-excitons is found to be 1.8 times the signal from single excitons at T = 0, consistent with the conventionally assumed factor of 2 within the 95% confidence intervals. The bi-exciton signal contains the same hot carrier relaxation dynamics as that from single excitons, but signal from a second exciton additionally exhibits a 26 ps exponential decay attributed to Auger recombination.","tags":null,"title":"Carrier Dynamics and Interactions for Bulk-Like Photoexcitation of Colloidal Indium Arsenide Quantum Dots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Austin P.

However, the structure and dynamics of complex systems in the condensed-phase, especially far from thermal equilibrium, is masked by broad, and often features, absorption and emission spectra. Nonlinear optical spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful and general approach to disentangling congested spectra by spreading information across multiple dimensions, revealing features oftentimes hidden in lower-order projections. As the dimensionality of the measurement increases, the better the microscopic interactions are revealed as spectral bands disperse in the large hyper-spectral volume. This, however, comes at a steep price as the signal decreases exponentially with increasing noise and experimental complexity. Here, we discuss a four-dimensional coherent spectroscopy that reveals coupling between electronic and vibrational transitions in complex, condensed-phase systems ranging from organic molecules to semiconductor nanocrystals. We reveal that high-resolution spectra may be extracted from these systems even in the presence of severe spectral broadening, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous in origin. The theoretical and experimental underpinnings of this method are discussed.

Optical phonon lines in a colloidal solution of CdSe quantum dots at room temperature separated by less than 150 $μ$eV are resolved despite the homogeneous line width of these transitions being nearly an order of magnitude broader. The frequency difference between these phonon modes is attributed to softening of the longitudinal phonon mode upon excitation to the lowest exciton state.

Experimental distortions from the spatial propagation of pulses through the sample are simulated in 2DFT spectra calculated for the homogeneous Bloch line shape model. Spectral features that appear at optical densities of up to 3 are investigated. As optical density increases, absorptive and dispersive distortions start with peak shape broadening, progress to peak splitting, and ultimately result in a previously unexplored coherent transient twisting of the split peaks. In contrast to the low optical density limit, where the 2D peak shape for the Bloch model depends only on the total dephasing time, these distortions of the 2D peak shape at finite optical density vary with the waiting time and the excited state lifetime through coherent transient effects. Experiment-specific conditions are explored, demonstrating the effects of varying beam overlap within the sample and of pseudo-time domain filtering. For beam overlap starting at the sample entrance, decreasing the length of beam overlap reduces the line width along the $\\omega_\\tau$ axis but also reduces signal intensity. A pseudo-time domain filter, where signal prior to the center of the last excitation pulse is excluded from the FID-referenced 2D signal, reduces propagation distortions along the $\\omega_t$ axis.

The well-known heat of formation of SiCl4 is used as an anchor to determine the heat of formation of SiCl3+, which is, in turn, used as an anchor to determine the heats of formation of the other alkyltrichlorosilanes investigated. A series of isodesmic reactions at the G3 and CBS-QB3 levels are shown to accurately reproduce the experimental heats of formation, and this scheme is used to calculate the heat of formation of Si2Cl6, from which the measured E0 determines the SiCl3? heat of formation. The measured values then determine the IE of SiCl3? along with the Si?R bond dissociation enthalpies of the six neutral species investigated. The experimental heats of formation are also used in a series of isodesmic reaction calculations to determine the heats of formation of SiH3R (R = H, CH3, C2H5, C2H3, CH2Cl, SiCl3).","tags":null,"title":"Experimental Thermochemistry of SiCl3R (R = Cl, H, CH3, C2H5, C2H3, CH2Cl, SiCl3), SiCl3+, and SiCl3•","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Austin P Spencer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"92f3793457318209f17a62eb90becc32","permalink":"/publication/spencer-tpepico-2009/","publishdate":"2019-11-18T16:23:26.437272Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spencer-tpepico-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"TPEPICO Spectroscopy of SiCl4, SiCl3CH3, SiCl3CH2Cl, SiCl3C2H3, and SiCl3C2H5: Thermochemistry of Trichlorosilane Derivatives","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c9b5771543b03b8149b612b630936a56","permalink":"/experience/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/experience/","section":"","summary":"My academic and work experience.","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f1d044c0738ab9f19347f15c290a71a1","permalink":"/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"Overview of my research.","tags":null,"title":"Research","type":"widget_page"}]
