 abstract = {In optical two-dimensional Fourier-transform (2DFT) spectroscopy, understanding how the spectral line shape is affected by pulse propagation in the sample is crucial for an accurate interpretation of spectra. We report an experimental study of pulse propagation effects in 2DFT spectroscopy performed in a dense atomic vapor. The spectral line shape can be dramatically distorted due to high optical density as well as the physical thickness of a sample. The spectral distortion can be partially corrected by using a reference pulse copropagating with the signal combined with appropriate data processing.},
